# Approximating the Best Electrical Network Configuration

This project explores algorithms for approximating the **optimal electrical network configuration**, combining graph theory, exact methods, and metaheuristics.  
Developed as part of coursework in combinatorial optimization.

## Project Overview
We study the problem of finding an efficient spanning structure in a weighted network (electrical grid model).  
The repo includes implementations and experiments with:
- **Branch and Bound** (`branchnbound.ipynb`)
- **Approximation algorithms** (`Approximation.ipynb`, `appro+meta.ipynb`)
- **Metaheuristics** (`metaheuristic.ipynb`)
- **Graph experiments** (`test_networkx.py`, various `.pdf` plots)

The work is supported by a **report** (`modele_rapport.pdf`, `modele_rapport.tex`) and theoretical notes (`tp_en.pdf`).

## Key Techniques
- Graph representations with **NetworkX**
- Exact optimization with **branch & bound**
- Approximation strategies with performance guarantees
- Metaheuristics (e.g., simulated annealing, tabu search) for large instances
- Analysis of graph structures (dense, regular, power-law cluster graphs)
